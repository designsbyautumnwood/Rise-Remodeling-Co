      question: "How long does a typical remodeling project take?",
      answer: "Project timelines vary based on scope and complexity. Kitchen remodels typically take 3-6 weeks, bathroom renovations 2-4 weeks, and trim work 1-2 weeks. We provide detailed timelines during our consultation and keep you updated throughout the process."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between quotes and estimates?",
      answer: "We provide free, no-obligation quotes for all our services. A quote gives you a clear understanding of project scope and approximate costs. Detailed estimates, which include precise measurements and material specifications, require a small fee that's credited toward your project if you hire us. This ensures we can invest the time needed for accurate planning."
    },
    {
      question: "Are you licensed and insured?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Rise Remodeling Co. is fully licensed in South Carolina and carries comprehensive liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage. This protects both you and our team throughout the project."
    },
    {
      question: "What's included in your pricing?",
      answer: "Our transparent pricing includes all labor, materials, permits, and cleanup. We provide detailed breakdowns so you know exactly what you're paying for. No hidden fees or surprise chargesâ€”just honest, fair pricing."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle permits and inspections?",
      answer: "Yes, we handle all necessary permits and coordinate inspections with local authorities. Our team is familiar with Rock Hill and York County building codes, ensuring your project meets all requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need changes during the project?",
      answer: "We understand that projects can evolve. We maintain open communication and can accommodate reasonable changes. Any modifications will be discussed with you first, including time and cost implications, before proceeding."
